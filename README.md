# One Framework - Two State Management Libraries 

Here we have two Angular apps that are - from the end User's presepective - identical in every way. 

But from the developer's prespective there is a world of difference. I'm not taking sides here - just want to give you a balanced side-by-side comparison of NGXS and NgRx. 

Watch the [video and read the article](https://angularfirebase.com). 

## Usage

```
cd ngxs && npm i
cd ngrx && npm i
```

## Salad Bar


## Benchmarks

Webpack bundle analyzer

```
cd ngxs && npm run analyzer
cd ngrx && npm run analyzer
```
